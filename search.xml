    <title>Why can&#39;t you divide a number by 0?</title>
    <url>/2021/04/10/Why-can-t-you-divide-a-number-by-0/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We know that a number cannot be divided by 0, but why?</p>
<h2 id="Elementary-School"><a href="#Elementary-School" class="headerlink" title="Elementary School"></a>Elementary School</h2><p>In elementary school arithmetic, this problem is very simple. At that time, we defined division as “divide a thing into several parts.” Dividing into one, two, three, four, five, six or seven parts is easy to imagine, but how do you divide 10 biscuits into 0 people? Can’t imagine it! So it cannot be divided.</p>
<p>A keen classmate might think that if 0 cookies are distributed to 0 people, there is nothing at all, it seems that it doesn’t matter. But since there is nothing and no one, it is possible for everyone to get a certain amount. It is impossible to give a single definite value.</p>
<p>This conclusion is correct, but it is all based on intuition. If you can’t imagine it, it doesn’t necessarily mean it doesn’t. Mathematics in ancient times was based on intuition. Shopping for food is enough, but to develop further, it must have definitions and proofs-so we went to middle school.</p>
<h2 id="Junior-High-School"><a href="#Junior-High-School" class="headerlink" title="Junior High School"></a>Junior High School</h2><p>Now we are beginning to get in touch with the most basic algebra—that is, solving equations. We found that division and multiplication are the inverse operations of each other, so ask</p>
<p><code>1/0 =?</code></p>
<p>Is equivalent to solving the equation</p>
<p><code>0 * x = 1</code></p>
<p>Well, by definition, 0 multiplied by any number is 0, and it cannot be equal to 1, so the number that satisfies x does not exist, so it cannot be divided.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you ask</p>
<p><code>0/0 =?</code></p>
<p>Is equivalent to solving the equation</p>
<p><code>0 * x = 0</code></p>
<p>In the same way, any number can satisfy x, so it cannot be divided-a single answer cannot be determined.</p>
<h2 id="High-School"><a href="#High-School" class="headerlink" title="High School"></a>High School</h2><p>When we come into contact with basic formal logic, we will find another way of proof: the method of proof by contradiction.</p>
<p>A bunch of true expressions cannot infer a false expression, so if we add a bunch of true expressions with “can be divided by zero normally” and finally introduce a false one, it can only show the “divide by zero”. This thing is no longer true.</p>
<p>So, it is known</p>
<p><code>0 * 1 = 0</code></p>
<p><code>0 * 2 = 0</code></p>
<p>Launch <code>0 * 1 = 0 * 2</code></p>
<p>Divide both sides by zero at the same time to get <code>(0/0) * 1 = (0/0) * 2</code></p>
<p>Simplify to get <code>1 = 2</code>. <strong>This is obviously wrong.</strong></p>
<p>So, the problem is solved! Actually not yet. Think about another question: What is the square root of -1?</p>
<p>You might say that -1 cannot take a square root, because the squares of all numbers are non-negative. But this is talking about real numbers. What if I add a definition? Define <code>i^2=-1</code>, which creates an imaginary number, so -1 can also take the square root.</p>
<p>So, why can’t we define a “new” number so that <code>1/0</code> is also equal to it, and set up a set of algorithms for this number? This has to be answered at the university.</p>
<h2 id="University-Grade-1"><a href="#University-Grade-1" class="headerlink" title="University - Grade 1"></a>University - Grade 1</h2><p>When you just learn the calculus course, you will immediately be exposed to the symbol ∞. Hey, isn’t this “infinite”. We have all learned the concept of the limit, so I make b tend to 0, and then define the limit of a/b as infinity, can’t it?</p>
<p>This immediately encountered a problem, its left limit and right limit are not the same. Does b approach 0 from the negative end, or the positive end? This one is getting more and more negative, and the other is getting more and more positive. There is no way to define such a limit.</p>
<p>Therefore, the calculus course will repeatedly say that although the symbol ∞ is used, it only represents a trend and is definitely not a real number, so it cannot be used in calculations.</p>
<h2 id="University-Grade-2"><a href="#University-Grade-2" class="headerlink" title="University - Grade 2"></a>University - Grade 2</h2><p>Then learn the lesson, I don’t need ready-made symbols, I directly define <code>1/0 = w</code>, w is an _”infinite”_ number, do not touch any limit, you have nothing to say!</p>
<p>However, the definition does not come from the ground up. Although you can define things as you like, but after the definition is inconsistent with other existing systems, it cannot be used, or it is very difficult to use.</p>
<p>And we ran into problems immediately when faced with w. First of all, how does w fit into the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division system? What is 1 + w? What is w-w? If you make a number, but you can’t even add, subtract, multiply and divide, it’s not very useful, right.</p>
<p>For example, intuitively, 1 + w should be equal to w, it is infinite! And w-w is equal to 0, so subtract yourself!</p>
<p>But this will immediately conflict with the extremely important “associative law” in addition: <code>1 + (w-w) = 1 + 0 = 1</code>, but <code>(1 + w)-w = w-w = 0</code>. The associative law is a very basic thing in addition. For a w, even the associative law is not necessary. This cost is a bit high-not only the associative law itself, but also in the process of proving many mathematical theorems. We have to start all over again and establish a new system. The new system is not impossible to build, but it is laborious and (temporarily) useless, so everyone is still using the old one—and in the old one, in order to preserve the associative law, you can’t play like that.</p>
<p>Readers are welcome to use their imagination and try to give the calculation method for w. But you will find that no matter how you stipulate the relationship between w and other numbers, as long as you insist that 1/0 = w, you can’t make it not contradict the basic mathematics you have learned since childhood. Still that sentence, you can set up another door to build your new mathematics on the basis of w, but it is incompatible with most traditional mathematics, and it will definitely be very difficult to use, so we used one. The division by zero system is very reasonable.</p>
<h2 id="University-Grade-3"><a href="#University-Grade-3" class="headerlink" title="University - Grade 3"></a>University - Grade 3</h2><p>You may object: There are so many definitions, have I tried them all? If I haven’t tried it, how do I know that a self-consistent solution will not come up someday?</p>
<p>“New discoveries overthrow old conclusions” can happen in biology, in chemistry, and in physics, but not in mathematics. Because mathematics is based on logic, there are exceptions to individual cases, and no exceptions to logic. Of course, our mathematics has not yet completed the final axiomatization, and we have to face Gödel’s ghost, but at least in this example, if w is a real number, then it violates some very important axioms, and these axioms The status is very deep.</p>
<p>For example, there is a set of basic axioms called “Piano Axioms”. One of them says that every certain natural number has a certain successor, and the successor is also a natural number; the other says that natural number b=c, if and only if b is Successor = successor of c.</p>
<p>Then whose successor is w—or, who can add 1 to get w? Obviously all other numbers have their own successors, w has no place in them, and no other number plus 1 can become w. Then it can only be 1+w=w, but it directly contradicts the second sentence. Without Peano’s axiom, the entire system of natural numbers cannot be established.</p>
<p>It is assumed that w is a natural number. Other situations will be slightly more complicated, but in any case, similar things happen in various definitions of w. If you want to treat w as a number, it will not be compatible with our existing real numbers. Therefore, we can only declare in almost all situations, and cannot divide by zero.</p>
<h2 id="University-Grade-4-and-above"><a href="#University-Grade-4-and-above" class="headerlink" title="University - Grade 4 and above"></a>University - Grade 4 and above</h2><p>Since we said “almost” before, there are exceptions-in some strange occasions, yes.</p>
<p>For example, there is something called “complex infinity”, it is a point on the extended complex plane, it is really a point with definition. Under this special rule, you can write an expression like <code>1/0 = ∞</code>. The reason for this is a long story, but it is not an operation in the usual sense-for example, you can’t get 0 back, and you can’t write <code>1 = 0 * ∞</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, the word “infinity” can be treated as a “thing” in some other situations. For example, when you measure the size of a set, it can be infinite. But there are many different kinds of infinities-natural numbers are infinitely many, rational numbers are infinitely many, real numbers are also infinitely many, but odd and even numbers and positive and negative integers are as many as natural and rational numbers, while real numbers are infinitely many. More than them! The same is infinity, and some infinity is more infinite than others. But this is another topic, stop it.</p>

    <title>Why we need to learn English?</title>
    <url>/2021/05/22/Why-we-need-to-learn-English/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Out of the 6 500 spoken languages in the world today, why choose to learn English? As the third most widely spoken language in the world, English is widely spoken and taught in over 118 countries and is commonly used around the world as a trade language or diplomatic language. It is the language of science, aviation, computers, diplomacy, and tourism. Last but not least, it is the language of international communication, the media, and the internet.<br>Whether it is for professional or personal reasons, understanding the importance of English will help you reach your goals. Here are a few reasons why you should keep learning and practicing your English language skills.</p>
<h2 id="English-is-the-Language-of-International-Communication"><a href="#English-is-the-Language-of-International-Communication" class="headerlink" title="English is the Language of International Communication"></a>English is the Language of International Communication</h2><p>Although English is not the most spoken language in the world, it is the official language in 53 countries and is spoken as a first language by around 400 million people worldwide. But that’s not all, it is also the most common second language in the world. According to a survey recently, by 2020,  about two billion people in the world will be studying English.<br>Therefore, it is highly likely that if you meet someone from another country, you will both be able to speak English. It gives you an open door to the world and helps you communicate with global citizens.</p>
<h2 id="English-gives-access-to-more-entertainment-and-more-access-to-the-Internet"><a href="#English-gives-access-to-more-entertainment-and-more-access-to-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="English gives access to more entertainment and more access to the Internet"></a>English gives access to more entertainment and more access to the Internet</h2><p>Nowadays, many films, TV shows, books, and music are published and produced in English. By understanding English, you won’t need to rely on translations and subtitles anymore. By accessing these media, you will also continuously improve your English listening and reading skills.<br>English is currently the language of the internet. An estimated 565 million people use the internet every day and about 52% of the world’s most visited websites are displayed in English. Therefore, learning this language gives access to over half the content of the internet, which might not be available otherwise. Whether it is for fun or work, if you understand English, you will be able to exchange information with more people online and use many more materials.</p>
<h2 id="English-makes-it-easier-to-travel"><a href="#English-makes-it-easier-to-travel" class="headerlink" title="English makes it easier to travel"></a>English makes it easier to travel</h2><p>As highlighted before, since English is spoken as a first language in 53 countries and as a second language in over 118 countries, learning the language makes it much easier to travel anywhere. Indeed, airport announcements, train timetables, emergency information, and street signs are often available in English, including in countries where the native language uses a different type of alphabet. When traveling to a country where you don’t speak the language, you are practically guaranteed to find someone who understands at least some English.</p>
<h2 id="English-can-make-you-‘smarter’"><a href="#English-can-make-you-‘smarter’" class="headerlink" title="English can make you ‘smarter’"></a>English can make you ‘smarter’</h2><p>Learning a foreign language enhances your cognitive and analytical abilities. Learning a new language can be difficult and it involves a lot of mental exercises. Research from a ‘2012 Swiss Study’(which is a very official academic survey) shows that learning a new language changes the brain structures, impacting the parts of the brain responsible for memory, conscious thought and it can make you more creative. In the long term, bilingualism can keep the brain strong and healthy into old age and supports concentration and memory skills. On an individual level, it improves personality and increases the sense of self-worth. In simple words, learning a foreign language makes the brain stronger and more versatile.<br>Learning English is not only useful, but it also gives a lot of satisfaction, and making progress will make you feel great. That’s why we’ll need to learn English, even we may don’t have a chance to use it.</p>
